# Custom Page Sizes Proposal for WebAssembly

This repository is a clone of
[`WebAssembly/spec`](https://github.com/WebAssembly/spec/). It is meant for
discussion, prototype specification, and implementation of a proposal to add
support for custom page sizes for WebAssembly memories.

* See the [overview](./proposals/custom-page-sizes/Overview.md) for a high-level
  summary and rationale of the proposal.

Original README from upstream repository follows...

# spec

This repository holds the sources for the WebAssembly specification,
a reference implementation, and the official test suite.

A formatted version of the spec is available here:
[webassembly.github.io/spec](https://webassembly.github.io/spec/),

Participation is welcome. Discussions about new features, significant semantic
changes, or any specification change likely to generate substantial discussion
should take place in
[the WebAssembly design repository](https://github.com/WebAssembly/design)
first, so that this spec repository can remain focused. And please follow the
[guidelines for contributing](Contributing.md).

# citing

For citing WebAssembly in LaTeX, use [this bibtex file](wasm-specs.bib).
